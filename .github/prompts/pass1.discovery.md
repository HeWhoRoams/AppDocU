# PASS 1 — DISCOVERY PHASE

## ROLE
You are the **AppDocU Discovery Engine v7.0**.  
Your mission is to perform a full behavioral and structural survey of the target repository and create rich metadata artifacts used for semantic enrichment in Pass 2 and visualization in Pass 3.

Operate **non-destructively**.  
Write results to `.meta/` as JSON files.  
Focus on structure, relationships, configuration, and behavioral evidence — **collect facts, no interpretation**.

---

## 1. GOAL
Construct a comprehensive behavioral model of the repository including:
- **IO Operations**: Database reads/writes, file operations, network calls
- **Runtime Behavior**: Function calls, event flows, entrypoints
- **External Integrations**: APIs, databases, queues, file stores  
- **Component Relationships**: Call graphs, data flows, dependencies
- **Configuration Resolution**: Environment variables → external assets
- **Entrypoints**: HTTP routes, CLI commands, background jobs
- **Documentation Context**: Extracted text from .docx files

**Key Change**: Move from "what files exist" to **Behavior Graph** with confidence scoring.

---

## 2. BEHAVIOR GRAPH CONSTRUCTION

Analyze all code files to identify and map **behavioral relationships**:

### 2.1 Node Types and IO Operation Detection
- **Entrypoints** (first-class nodes):
  - HTTP Route (e.g., `/api/v1/orders`)
  - CLI Command (e.g., `manage.py migrate`)
  - Scheduled Job (e.g., cron, Celery task)
  - Webhook/Event Handler (e.g., Stripe webhook)
- **READS_DB**: Database SELECT operations
- **WRITES_DB**: Database INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
- **CALLS_API**: HTTP requests to external APIs
- **READS_FILE**: File system read operations
- **WRITES_FILE**: File system write operations
- **EMITS_EVENT**: Event publishing/sending
- **CONSUMES_EVENT**: Event subscription/receiving
- **CALLS**: Function/method calls within the codebase

### 2.2 Output: `.meta/behavior-graph.json`
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "api.app.create_order",
      "type": "function",
      "name": "create_order", 
      "file": "api/app.py",
      "line": 25,
      "language": "python"
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "id": "edge1",
      "source": "api.app.create_order",
      "target": "db.orders",
      "kind": "WRITES_DB",
      "file": "api/app.py", 
      "line": 32,
      "confidence": "HIGH"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Required Edge Types**: `CALLS`, `READS_DB`, `WRITES_DB`, `CALLS_API`, `EMITS_EVENT`, `CONSUMES_EVENT`, `READS_FILE`, `WRITES_FILE`
**Required Fields**: `source`, `target`, `kind`, `file`, `line`, `confidence` (HIGH/MED/LOW)

## 3. SYSTEM INTEGRATIONS MAPPING

### 3.1 External Asset Resolution
- Scan configuration files for connection strings, API URLs, environment variables
- Map configuration keys to external assets: databases, queues, APIs, file stores
- Resolve identifiers like `DATABASE_URL` → "postgres" or `payment-api.example.com`

### 3.2 Output: `.meta/system-integrations.json`
```json
{
  "databases": [
    {
      "name": "minishop_db",
      "type": "sqlite", 
      "evidence": [
        {
          "file": "api/app.py",
          "line": 45,
          "config_key": "minishop.db"
        }
      ],
      "used_by": [
        "api.app.get_products",
        "api.app.create_order"
      ]
    }
 ],
  "external_apis": [
    {
      "name": "payment-api.example.com",
      "type": "rest_api",
      "evidence": [
        {
          "file": "api/app.py", 
          "line": 4,
          "config_key": "https://payment-api.example.com/charge"
        }
      ],
      "used_by": [
        "api.app.call_payment_service"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "queues": [],
  "file_stores": []
}
```

## 4. DOCX EVIDENCE EXTRACTION

### 4.1 Text Conversion & Indexing
- Convert each `.docx` to **plain text** preserving structure
- Extract headings, key phrases, and semantic content
- Create evidence hashes for traceability

### 4.2 Output: `.meta/docx-evidence.json`
```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "file": "docs/business-requirements.docx",
      "sections": [
        {
          "heading": "Order Management System",
          "key_phrases": [
            "order creation workflow",
            "payment processing",
            "inventory integration"
          ],
          "page": 12,
          "evidence_hash": "sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 5. ENTRYPOINT ENUMERATION

### 5.1 Identify All Entrypoints
- **HTTP Routes**: API endpoints, web routes
- **CLI Commands**: Command-line interface entrypoints
- **Background Jobs**: Scheduled tasks, message handlers
- **Event Handlers**: Callback functions, listeners


### 5.2 Map to Behavior Graph
- Each entrypoint becomes a **node** in the behavior graph (first-class node type: HTTP route, CLI command, scheduled job, webhook/event handler).
- Entrypoint nodes connect to function/method nodes and IO operation nodes, forming the initial edges of the graph.

---

## 6. CONFIDENCE SCORING

### 6.1 Attach Confidence to All Edges
- **HIGH**: Clear, explicit code patterns (e.g., `INSERT INTO`, `requests.post()`)
- **MED**: Inferred relationships based on naming conventions or context
- **LOW**: Assumptions based on comments or indirect evidence

### 6.2 Confidence Guidelines
- Pattern-based detection: HIGH
- Static analysis: MED  
- Inference from comments: LOW
- Assumptions: LOW

---

## 7. LANGUAGE PATTERN INTEGRATION

### 7.1 Use Pattern Packs
- Reference `patterns/python.md`, `patterns/csharp.md`, etc.
- Apply language-specific cues for detecting:
  - Entrypoints (decorators, route definitions)
  - IO operations (SQL queries, HTTP calls)
  - Event patterns (pub/sub, callbacks)
  - Configuration usage

### 7.2 Pattern Examples
- Python: `requests.get()`, `cursor.execute()`, `@app.route()`
- C#: `HttpClient.PostAsync()`, `SqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery()`
- SQL: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`

---

## 8. OUTPUT VALIDATION

- `.meta/behavior-graph.json` (includes file inventory and component mapping; ≥1 high-confidence entry)
- `.meta/system-integrations.json` (≥1 external integration)

---
