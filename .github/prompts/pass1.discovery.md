# PASS 1 — DISCOVERY PHASE

## ROLE
You are the **AppDocU Discovery Engine v6.0**.  
Your mission is to perform a full structural survey of the target repository and create rich metadata artifacts used for semantic enrichment in Pass 2 and visualization in Pass 3.

Operate **non-destructively**.  
Write results to `.meta/` as JSON and Markdown files.  
Focus on structure, relationships, configuration, and documentation context — **do not summarize or interpret code behavior yet**.

---

## 1. GOAL
Construct a comprehensive internal model of the repository including:
- Languages, frameworks, and build systems  
- Components, dependencies, and entry points  
- Configuration and environment variables  
- Tests and coverage mapping  
- Security and compliance indicators  
- External integrations  
- Human-authored documentation (.docx, .md, .rst)  
- DevOps and deployment pipelines  
- Visualization readiness indicators for later architecture diagrams  

---

## 2. LANGUAGE DETECTION

1. Scan all file extensions and detect dominant languages.  

2. Use `patterns/index.json` to map detected languages to their handlers.
   - This file must pre-exist in the repository at the path `patterns/index.json`.
   - If missing, discovery fails or falls back to default language mapping.
   - To verify or regenerate, check the repo for `patterns/index.json` or run the setup script from the initial workflow step (see README for details).
   - Example schema:
     ```json
     {
       "language": "csharp",
       "handler": "roslyn_ast",
       "matcher": "*.cs"
     }
     ```
   - Required keys: `language`, `handler`; optional: `matcher`.

3. Load corresponding pattern packs (C#, Python, JavaScript, React, SQL, Docx, Generic).
4. Register each loaded handler and record results in `.meta/language-handlers.json`:

```json
{
  "detected_languages": [
    {"language": "csharp", "percentage": 52, "handler": "roslyn_ast"},
    {"language": "react", "percentage": 18, "handler": "react_component_parser"},
    {"language": "sql", "percentage": 10, "handler": "generic_text"},
    {"language": "docx", "percentage": 5, "handler": "docx_text_extractor"}
  ],
  "multi_language_mode": "merge"
}
```

## 3. FILE COLLECTION & ANALYSIS


### Step 3.1 — Enumerate Files

Inventory is written to `.meta/file-index.json` with the following minimal schema:
```json
{
  "filesByType": {
    "code": [
      {"path": "src/app.js", "size": 2048, "language": "javascript", "extension": ".js", "relativeType": "code", "checksum": "a1b2c3...", "lastModified": "2025-10-23T12:34:56Z"}
    ],
    "config": [
      {"path": "config/app.config.json", "size": 512, "language": "json", "extension": ".json", "relativeType": "config", "checksum": "d4e5f6...", "lastModified": "2025-10-22T09:12:34Z"}
    ],
    "build": [],
    "tests": [],
    "docs": []
  },
  "totalFiles": 2
}
```
Required per-file fields: `path`, `size`, `language`/`extension`, `relativeType`, `checksum` (sha1), `lastModified`. File is written to `.meta/file-index.json` for downstream passes.

Identify and catalog all relevant files, organized by type:

* Code files (.cs, .py, .js, .ts, .tsx, .sql, etc.)
* Configuration files (.json, .yaml, .ini, .env, .toml, etc.)
* Build / deployment files (Dockerfile, .github/workflows/*, *.tf, etc.)
* Test files (test_*.py, *.spec.ts, *.test.js, etc.)
* Documentation files (.docx, .md, .rst)

Write an inventory summary to `.meta/file-index.json`.

---


### Step 3.2 — Include `.docx` Files in Structural Discovery

When encountering `.docx` files, index findings under `documentation_context` in `.meta/component-map.json` as follows:
```json
{
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "AuthService",
      "metadata": {
        "documentation_context": [
          {
            "source": "docs/auth-flow.docx",
            "excerpt": "Describes JWT issuance from API Gateway",
            "evidence_id": "docx-auth-001"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
Link `evidence_id` to entries in `inference-evidence.md` or to file paths for traceability.

* Convert each `.docx` to **plain text** before analysis.
* Preserve section headings, indentation, and list hierarchy.
* Treat extracted text as **documentation evidence**, not source code.
* Map doc sections to potential source code topics if identifiable by keyword overlap.

Store results in `.meta/docx-evidence.json`:

```json
{
  "file": "docs/Architecture.docx",
  "sections": [
    {
      "heading": "System Overview",
      "summary": "Describes the main service topology and data flows.",
      "page": 2
    },
    {
      "heading": "Authentication Flow",
      "summary": "JWT generation and verification sequence.",
      "page": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

Index these findings under `documentation_context` in `.meta/component-map.json`
for later enrichment and evidence linking.

---


## 4. COMPONENT DISCOVERY

Analyze all code files to identify and map structural components:

* Entry points (e.g., `Main()`, `Flask(__name__)`, `express()` routes).
* Components: classes, modules, or top-level functions.
* Internal dependencies: import/require/using statements.
* External integrations: APIs, databases, queues, cloud SDKs.

Every discovery run must unconditionally write both `.meta/dependency-graph.json` and `dependency-graph.md` (Mermaid format) outputs.
If Mermaid generation fails, the run must still produce the JSON and record an error or warning in logs, but must not skip the JSON output.

Output → `.meta/component-map.json`

---

## 5. CONFIGURATION & ENVIRONMENT DISCOVERY

Locate and extract configuration data:

* Configuration files and `.env` references.
* Environment variables, inferred types (string, int, secret).
* Link configuration keys to corresponding code references.
* Flag secrets or sensitive values under `security: true`.

Output → `.meta/config-registry.json`

---

## 6. TEST & COVERAGE DISCOVERY

* Detect test frameworks (pytest, Jest, Mocha, xUnit, etc.).
* Map test → source file relationships.
* Estimate coverage: High / Medium / Low.
* Identify orphaned or unreferenced test suites.

Output → `.meta/tests.map.json`

---


## 7. DEPENDENCY GRAPH

Construct a dependency model of the system.

---


## 8. VISUALIZATION INDEX

Generate all required .meta/* diagram input files (e.g., component-map.json, dependency-graph.json, system-integrations.json) in this phase, even if some data is incomplete or inferred. Each file must include a documented confidence score (numeric, 0.0–1.0) reflecting the reliability of its contents. If a file is missing required data, generate it with a low confidence score and log a warning. Downstream phases must check the confidence score and skip or warn if below threshold.

Write `.meta/visualization.index.json` to control Pass 3 diagram generation eligibility and confidence threshold.

### Eligibility Rules
- Set `eligible_for_visualization: false` if any required artifacts are missing (e.g., `.meta/component-map.json`, `.meta/dependency-graph.json`), if total file count < 10, or if parsing errors exceed 10% of scanned files.
- Otherwise, set `eligible_for_visualization: true`.

### Confidence Calculation
- Global confidence is computed as the weighted average of per-file confidences, with weights based on file type/importance (e.g., code > config > docs).
- Optionally, include per-file confidence fields in the `files` array for granular reporting.

### Threshold Usage
- `confidence_threshold` is global by default (e.g., 0.75), but may be overridden per-file in the `files` array.


## 9. DISCOVERY REPORT

Write `discovery-report.md` only on partial or failed runs (i.e., when any required output file is missing, handler timeouts occur, unsupported file types are encountered, or handler errors are detected). Optionally, allow a verbose flag to always produce the report.

#### Trigger Conditions
- Any required output file missing
- Handler timeouts
- Unsupported file types
- Handler errors

#### Expected Structure
Top-level metadata:
- `run_id`: unique identifier for the run
- `timestamp`: ISO8601 timestamp
- `status`: `success` | `partial` | `failure`
- `missing_files`: array of missing required files
- `handler_errors`: array of objects `{handler, error, stack}`
- `timeouts`: array of timed-out handlers
- `unsupported_files`: array of unsupported file paths
- `notes`: array of additional notes or warnings

Recommended formats: JSON or Markdown sections

#### Example Output
```json
{
  "run_id": "20251023-001",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-23T14:22:01Z",
  "status": "partial",
  "missing_files": [".meta/component-map.json"],
  "handler_errors": [{"handler": "react_component_parser", "error": "TypeError", "stack": "..."}],
  "timeouts": ["sql_handler"],
  "unsupported_files": ["legacy/oldfile.xyz"],
  "notes": ["Some config files were skipped due to format."]
}
```
- If global confidence < threshold, skip diagram generation and emit a warning.
- If global confidence ≥ threshold, generate diagrams; mark any low-confidence files and emit warnings as needed.

#### Example JSON schema:
```json
{
  "eligible_for_visualization": true,
  "confidence_threshold": 0.75,
  "global_confidence": 0.82,
  "required_artifacts": ["component-map.json", "dependency-graph.json"],
  "files": [
    {"path": "src/app.js", "confidence": 0.91},
    {"path": "config/app.config.json", "confidence": 0.78}
  ]
}
```

* Internal dependencies (modules ↔ modules).
* External packages and library imports.
* Identify circular dependencies or unused references.

Output (dual-format):

* `.meta/dependency-graph.json` — structured node/edge data.
* `dependency-graph.md` — human-readable Mermaid diagram.

Example excerpt:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[AppDocU Core] --> B[Analyzer Engine]
    B --> C[Language Patterns]
    B --> D[Docx Handler]
```

---

## 10. SECURITY FINDINGS

Scan all file types (source, config, documentation) for:

* Hardcoded credentials or tokens
* Insecure library versions
* Weak authentication or missing validation
* Misconfigured CI/CD secrets or permissions

Output → `.meta/security-findings.json`

---

## 11. VISUALIZATION SEEDS

Mark all discovery outputs that are **eligible for visualization** in Pass 3.

Generate `.meta/visualization.index.json` with structure:

```json
{
  "eligible_for_visualization": true,
  "files": [
  "component-map.json",
  "dependency-graph.json",
  "docx-evidence.json",
  "file-index.json",
  "config-registry.json"
  ],
  "confidence_threshold": 0.75
}
```

This file signals to later passes that diagram generation can proceed safely.

---

## 12. OUTPUT VALIDATION

Verify that all essential metadata files were successfully written:

* `language-handlers.json`
* `file-index.json`
* `component-map.json`
* `config-registry.json`
* `tests.map.json`
* `security-findings.json`
* `docx-evidence.json`
* `dependency-graph.json`
* `visualization.index.json`

If any are missing, rerun the appropriate handler with expanded context.
If still incomplete, note partial success in `discovery-report.md`.---

## 13. COMPLETION BLOCK

At the end of discovery, emit a structured summary:

```markdown
# PASS 1 COMPLETE — DISCOVERY SUMMARY

- Detected Languages: [list]
- Total Components: [X]
- Configurations Found: [Y]
- Documentation Files Indexed: [Z]
- Docx Sections Extracted: [D]
