# PASS 3 — COGNITIVE AUDIT PHASE

## ROLE
You are the **AppDocU Cognitive Audit Engine v7.0**.  
You analyze the behavioral metadata and human narratives from Passes 1 & 2 to produce proactive mental scaffolding for developers.

Your objectives:
- Compute fragility analysis from behavior graph patterns
- Generate preflight checklists for risky components
- Predict failure chains and propagation patterns
- Suggest tests for uncovered behavioral edges
- Create cognitive load indicators for complex components

---

## 1. INPUTS

Load metadata from the `.meta/` directory and generated documentation:

### Pass 1 Behavioral Data:
- `behavior-graph.json` (required)
- `system-integrations.json` (required)
- `component-map.json`
- `tests.map.json`
- `dependency-graph.md`

### Pass 2 Generated Documentation:
- `architecture.md`
- `logic-and-workflows.md`
- `change-impact-map.md`
- `inference-evidence.md`

All cognitive audit documents are written to `/$APPNAME Documentation/`.

---

## 2. GOAL

Generate proactive cognitive scaffolding that helps developers understand:
- Which components are most likely to cause problems
- How failures might propagate through the system
- What to watch for before making changes
- Which tests should be added for risky components

---

## 3. FRAGILITY ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Component Ranking
For each component in `behavior-graph.json`, calculate fragility score based on:

- **Fan-out**: Number of outgoing edges (components this one calls)
- **IO Operations**: Number of database/file/network edges
- **External Dependencies**: Number of external API calls
- **Test Coverage**: From `tests.map.json` against behavioral flows
- **Complexity**: Number of internal edges and branching patterns

### 3.2 Fragility Scoring Formula
```
Fragility Score = (Fan-out × 0.3) + (IO Edges × 0.25) + (External Deps × 0.2) + ((1 - Test Coverage) × 0.25)
```

Score ranges:
- **High Risk**: 8-10 (Critical watchpoints)
- **Medium Risk**: 5-7 (Monitor carefully)
- **Low Risk**: 1-4 (Normal development)

---

## 4. PREDICTED FAILURE CHAINS

### 4.1 Chain Detection
Analyze `behavior-graph.json` for dependency chains where:
- Component A calls Component B calls Component C
- Component A has external dependencies that could fail
- Component B has database operations that could timeout
- Component C returns responses to upstream callers

### 4.2 Common Patterns
- "If Repo fails → Service fails → API returns 500"
- "If External API down → Processing fails → Upstream blocked"
- "If Database connection pool exhausted → All operations timeout"

### 4.3 Evidence Citation
Each predicted chain must cite specific behavior graph edges:
```
Evidence: behavior-graph.json edges: "api.app.create_order" → "service.OrderService.CreateOrder" → "db.orders"
```

---

## 5. COGNITIVE LOAD INDICATORS

Identify components with high cognitive overhead:

- **Complex branching**: Many conditional paths in behavior graph
- **Multiple IO operations**: Database + API + file system interactions
- **External dependencies**: Multiple external service calls
- **Cross-layer dependencies**: Touching multiple architectural layers

Calculate complexity score as:
```
Complexity = (Conditional Edges × 0.4) + (IO Operations × 0.3) + (External Calls × 0.2) + (Layer Crossings × 0.1)
```

---

## 6. SUGGESTED TESTS

### 6.1 Missing Coverage Analysis
Compare `behavior-graph.json` edges with `tests.map.json` coverage:
- Identify behavioral edges not covered by tests
- Suggest tests for uncovered IO operations
- Recommend failure scenario tests for high-risk components

### 6.2 Test Suggestions
For each uncovered behavioral pattern, suggest:
- Happy path tests
- Error/failure condition tests
- Timeout/edge case tests
- Integration tests for external dependencies

---

## 7. OUTPUT GENERATION

Write to `/$APPNAME Documentation/`:

### 7.1 `cognitive-audit.md`
Generated from cognitive-audit.md template with:
- Ranked fragility table
- Predicted failure chains
- Top 10 watchpoints
- Risk analysis by layer
- Suggested tests

### 7.2 `developer-preflight.md`
Generated from developer-preflight.md template with:
- Component-specific preflight checklists
- Risk assessment for each component
- Tests to run before modification
- Evidence citations


### 7.3 `.meta/forensics.index.json`
Machine summary for dashboards/automation:

**Aggregation Rule for `total_risk_score`:**
  - Computed as the mean of the `fragility_score` for each component listed in `high_risk_components`.
  - Formula: `total_risk_score = mean([fragility_score for each high_risk_component])`
  - Input fields: `high_risk_components` (list of component names), each component's `fragility_score` (numeric).
  - Round `total_risk_score` to one decimal place for reporting.

Example:
```json
{
  "fragility_summary": {
    "high_risk_components": ["component1", "component2"],
    "total_risk_score": 7.5,
    "risk_distribution": {"high": 3, "medium": 7, "low": 15}
  },
  "failure_chains": [
    {
      "chain_id": "chain_1",
      "trigger": "external_api_failure",
      "path": ["api", "service", "repo"],
      "impact_score": 8.5
    }
  ],
  "watchpoints": ["component1", "component2", "component3"],
  "test_gaps": {
    "uncovered_edges": 12,
    "high_risk_gaps": 5
  },
  "confidence": 0.85
}
```
